# effective-kotlin-book

This repository contains some open-sourced chapters of the Effective Kotlin. It is the place to suggest changes and make public discussions. Suggestions to the published chapters should be shared as PR, and to other chapters as issues.

## Format

The book is written in a Markua format, that is the official Leanpub format. Code formatting is to some degree shaped by the page size (so unnecessery line preaks are generally a way to avoid automatic code breaks that are not well formatted by Leanpub)

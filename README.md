# Effective Kotlin open sourced chapters

This repository contains some open-sourced chapters of the Effective Kotlin. It is the place to suggest changes and make public discussions. Suggestions to the published chapters should be shared as PR, and to other chapters as issues.

## Chapters

Currently only one chapter is released, text only, no images: 

Chapter 6: Class Design

## Why?

Effective Kotlin was always primarily community-driven. In big part it was based on our community discussions, articles and talks. I want to keep it this way, or even make it more community driven by allowing community members to start here public discussions  or to directly suggest changes. 

This is an experiment. If it will work out - meaning influential discussions or suggestions - more and more chapters will be shared.

## Format

The book is written in a Markua format, that is the official Leanpub format. Code formatting is to some degree shaped by the page size (so unnecessery line preaks are generally a way to avoid automatic code breaks that are not well formatted by Leanpub)
